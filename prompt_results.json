It presents the information in the same sequence: identifying the person, stating the rivalry, and adding a second characteristic. The use of \"at\" (and) and \"rin\" (also) ensures the sentences connect logically.\n\n**Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point**\nThe translation is culturally appropriate.

A better translation would have maintained a consistent informal style throughout.\n\n**Completeness: 0 point**\nThe translation is incomplete because it entirely omits the word \"kinda.\" This word is a key piece of information that qualifies the statement about the rivalry, and its absence means a part of the original message is lost.\n\n**Total Score: 2 points**",

The original's power comes from its rhythmic, parallel structure. The translation's use of varied vocabulary breaks this parallelism, making the sentence less elegant and memorable than a more faithful rendition.)\nCoherence: 0 point (The coherence of the source text is reinforced by its strong parallel structure. The translation weakens this by breaking the repetition, especially in the final clause with \"pagiging ganoon,\" which is a less direct and less cohesive way to refer to the core idea.)\nCultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation uses a standard, neutral tone that is appropriate for the philosophical and witty nature of the quote. The vocabulary is suitable and holds no inappropriate cultural connotations.)\nGuideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation fails to adhere to the stylistic rule of preserving rhetorical devices from the source. A reference translation would maintain the parallelism by using a single, consistent term for \"mediocrity,\" a key feature that this translation disregards.)\nCompleteness: 1 point (All the essential informational components from the source text are present: the three distinct ways men encounter mediocrity—by birth, by achievement, and by imposition—are all included in the translated text.)\nTotal Score: 2 points",

    "llm_evaluation":"English source text: Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure.\nTranslated text: Sumakabilang-buhay si Inay ngayong araw. O baka kahapon; medyo nalilito na ako.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nA reference translation aiming for tonal fidelity to the famous literary source would be: \"Namatay si Inay ngayon. O baka kahapon; hindi ako sigurado.\" This reference prioritizes the blunt, detached tone of the original text.\n\n**Accuracy: 0 points**\nThe translation alters the core tone and meaning. \"Sumakabilang-buhay\" is a respectful euphemism for \"passed away,\" which contrasts sharply with the blunt and emotionally detached \"died\" in the source. Furthermore, \"medyo nalilito na ako\" (I'm a bit confused now) changes the narrator's statement of factual uncertainty (\"I can't be sure\") into a description of their emotional or mental state, which is a significant change in meaning.\n\n**Fluency: 1 point**\nThe translated sentence is grammatically correct and flows naturally in conversational Filipino. The phrasing is common and idiomatic for the subject matter in a typical Filipino context.\n\n**Coherence: 1 point**\nThe logical structure of the translation perfectly mirrors the source text. It presents a primary statement, followed by an alternative, and concludes with a statement of uncertainty. The flow is coherent and follows the original sequence.\n\n**Cultural Appropriateness: 0 points**\nThe source text's power comes from its *lack* of cultural appropriateness; the narrator's detachment is shocking. The translation imposes a culturally appropriate, respectful tone by using \"Sumakabilang-buhay.\" This \"correction\" fundamentally harms the original message and misrepresents the narrator's character, who is defined by his alienation.\n\n**Guideline Adherence: 0 points**\nThe domain is literary translation, where preserving the author's unique style is a key guideline. The translation deviates significantly from the source's stark and direct style, opting for a softer, more common register. This stylistic choice breaks the unwritten rule of fidelity to the tone of such a well-known piece of literature.\n\n**Completeness: 1 point**\nThe translation includes all the informational components of the source sentence: the mother, the event of death, the timeframe (today or yesterday), and the narrator's uncertainty. No part of the source sentence was omitted.\n\n**Total Score: 3 points**",

This captures the general idea but misses the specific nuance of \"sick of,\" which implies being tired of something from overexposure. A more accurate term would be \"Sawa ka na sa tsaa?!\". This slight difference in meaning reduces accuracy.)\nFluency: 1 point (The translated text is highly fluent and natural. The phrasing \"Parang sinabi mo na ring...\" is a common and idiomatic way to express comparison in Filipino, making the sentence flow very well.)\nCoherence: 1 point (The translation perfectly maintains the logical structure of the source text.
