The children laughed and played under the afternoon sun.,Ang mga bata ay nagtawanan at naglaro sa ilalim ng hapon na araw.,4,"Accurate, fluent, and natural translation. Captures the tone and meaning well.","Just slight error due to the literal translation of the ""afternoon sun"" to ""hapon na araw"". Afternoon sun means the Sun during the afternoon",Paul Ivan Enclonar/Alonzo Rimando,"English - The children laughed and played under the afternoon sun.
Translated - Ang mga bata ay nagtawanan at naglaro sa ilalim ng hapon na araw.
Accuracy: 1 point (The translation correctly conveys the core meaning: the children were engaged in the acts of laughing and playing, and their location was under the sun during the afternoon. No essential information is lost.)
Fluency: 0 point (The phrase ""hapon na araw"" is a very literal and unnatural-sounding translation of ""afternoon sun."" A more fluent and common phrasing would be ""araw ng hapon."" Additionally, the ""Ang... ay..."" structure is more formal and less common in everyday speech than the more natural inverted structure like ""Nagtawanan at naglaro ang mga bata..."")
Coherence: 0 point (The sentence structure, particularly the use of ""ay,"" separates the subject from the verb, making the flow less seamless compared to the reference style ""Nagtawanan at naglaro ang mga bata,"" which connects the action and the doer more directly and fluidly.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone of the translation is neutral and descriptive, which is perfectly appropriate for the source text. It does not contain any culturally inappropriate elements.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation deviates from the standard, idiomatic style represented by a reference translation. The use of ""hapon na araw"" instead of ""araw ng hapon"" and the formal ""ay"" construction are stylistic choices that break from the typical, natural phrasing.)
Completeness: 1 point (The translation includes all key components from the source text: ""the children"" (Ang mga bata), ""laughed and played"" (nagtawanan at naglaro), and ""under the afternoon sun"" (sa ilalim ng hapon na araw).)

She took a break to gather her thoughts.,Nagpahinga siya para mag-isip-isip.,4,"The translation is accurate. It was able to capture the meaning of the idiom ""gather her thoughts"", instead of translating it literally to ""kumuha ng ideya""",The translation would have been better if the translation also captured the gender indicated by the pronoun.,Paul Ivan Enclonar/Alonzo Rimando,"English - She took a break to gather her thoughts.
Translated - Nagpahinga siya para mag-isip-isip.

Accuracy: 1 point (The translation perfectly captures the source's meaning. ""Nagpahinga siya"" correctly translates ""She took a break,"" and ""para mag-isip-isip"" is an excellent idiomatic equivalent for ""to gather her thoughts,"" conveying the sense of contemplation and reflection.)
Fluency: 1 point (The translated sentence is highly fluent and natural in Filipino. The structure is common for native speakers, and the use of ""mag-isip-isip"" is a very common and natural way to express deep or prolonged thinking.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical structure of the translation mirrors the source text perfectly. It follows the same ""action + purpose"" flow (""She took a break"" + ""to gather her thoughts"" // ""Nagpahinga siya"" + ""para mag-isip-isip"") without any awkwardness.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is neutral and appropriate. The phrasing is standard and does not carry any unintended cultural connotations, making it suitable for any general context.)
Guideline Adherence: 1 point (The translation correctly uses an idiomatic Filipino phrase (""mag-isip-isip"") to match the English idiom (""gather her thoughts""), which represents a high-quality translation style. It avoids a literal, unnatural translation.)
Completeness: 1 point (All components of the source sentence—the subject (""she""), the action (""took a break""), and the purpose (""to gather her thoughts"")—are fully and accurately represented in the translation.)

The algorithm efficiently identifies patterns in large datasets.,Mabisang kinikilala ng algoritmo ang mga pattern sa malalaking dataset.,3,"The translation of ""identifies"" as ""kinikilala"" in the context of the sentence is not very accurate. The source text was translated literally.",The translation would have been better if the model didn't translated very literally.,Paul Ivan Enclonar/Alonzo Rimando,"English - The algorithm efficiently identifies patterns in large datasets.
Translated - Mabisang kinikilala ng algoritmo ang mga pattern sa malalaking dataset.

Accuracy: 1 point (The translation perfectly captures the original meaning. ""Mabisang"" is an excellent equivalent for ""efficiently,"" ""kinikilala"" for ""identifies,"" and the rest of the terms are translated accurately.)
Fluency: 1 point (The sentence structure ""Mabisang kinikilala ng..."" is natural, common, and fluent in Filipino. The word choice and grammar flow smoothly and do not sound stiff or literal.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical relationship between the algorithm, the action, and the data is clear and follows a standard Filipino sentence pattern. The flow is logical and easy to understand.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is neutral and technical, which is perfectly appropriate for the subject matter. There are no cultural missteps.)
Guideline Adherence: 1 point (The translation uses standard, widely accepted Filipino terminology for technical terms like ""algoritmo,"" ""pattern,"" and ""dataset,"" adhering to common practices in the domain.)
Completeness: 1 point (All components of the source sentence—the algorithm, the efficiency, the action of identifying, the patterns, and the large datasets—are fully present in the translation.)

Data normalization helps improve model performance.,Tumutulong sa pagpabuti ng model ang normalisasyon ng datos,5,The translated text is natural and captures the entire essence of the source text,"The translation didn't literally translated the text, and the model was able to capture the relationship between data normalization and model performance.",Paul Ivan Enclonar/Alonzo Rimando,"English - Data normalization helps improve model performance.
Translated - Tumutulong sa pagpabuti ng model ang normalisasyon ng datos

Accuracy: 0 point (The translation is inaccurate because it omits the word ""performance."" It translates ""model performance"" as simply ""model,"" which significantly alters the meaning. The source specifies what is being improved (performance), while the translation vaguely implies the model itself is being improved.)
Fluency: 1 point (The sentence structure ""Tumutulong sa [dative object] ang [subject]"" is a very natural and common Filipino construction (Verb-Object-Subject). The flow is smooth and idiomatic.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical structure is sound. The relationship between the subject (data normalization) and its action (helps improve) is clear, following a standard Filipino sentence pattern.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation uses a neutral, technical tone suitable for the subject matter, with no culturally inappropriate elements.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (In a technical or data science context, precision is key. Omitting ""performance"" is a significant deviation from domain-specific guidelines, which require translating all key technical terms accurately.)
Completeness: 0 point (The translation is incomplete. The key noun ""performance"" from the source text is entirely missing, leaving out a critical piece of information.)

alam mo ma'am masaya naman topics natin sa philosophy inaantok lang talaga ko kasi ikaw nagdidiscuss,"You know, ma'am, we have a lot of fun philosophy topics. I'm just really sleepy in what you're discussing.",4,"flawed translation is close, but failed to translate that the cause of antok is the ma'am and not the topic.",,Charibeth Cheng,"English source text: alam mo ma'am masaya naman topics natin sa philosophy inaantok lang talaga ko kasi ikaw nagdidiscuss
Translated text: You know, ma'am, we have a lot of fun philosophy topics. I'm just really sleepy in what you're discussing.

Accuracy: 0 point (The translation changes the core meaning. The source ""kasi ikaw nagdidiscuss"" means the speaker is sleepy *because* the teacher is the one discussing, implying the teacher is boring. The translation ""in what you're discussing"" changes the cause of sleepiness from the person to the topic of discussion, which is a significant semantic error.)

Fluency: 0 point (The phrase ""I'm just really sleepy in what you're discussing"" is grammatically awkward and unnatural. A more fluent phrasing would be ""I get sleepy when you discuss"" or ""...because you're the one discussing."" The use of ""in"" is not idiomatic in this context.)

Coherence: 0 point (The original text establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship with the word ""kasi"" (because). The translation breaks this logical link, replacing it with a weaker, contextual connection. This alters the logical flow and the intended punchline of the sentence.)

Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation successfully captures the informal, conversational tone of a student speaking to a teacher, using ""You know, ma'am."" The overall register is appropriate for the context implied by the source text.)

Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation fails to adhere to the fundamental rule of accurately conveying the source's semantic structure. It deviates by not translating the causative ""kasi,"" which is the most critical element of the source sentence's meaning.)

Completeness: 0 point (The translation omits a key piece of information: the true reason for the speaker's sleepiness. By changing ""because it's you"" to ""in what you're discussing,"" the information about the causal agent (the teacher) is lost and replaced with incorrect information.)

It's raining cats and dogs.,Umuulan ng pusa at aso.,1,"Literal translation of an idiom, doesn't make sense in Filipino.",Fails to capture the idiomatic meaning; sounds nonsensical.,Roi Victor Roberto / Alfonso Fermin,"English - It's raining cats and dogs.
Translated - Umuulan ng pusa at aso.
Accuracy: 0 point (The translation is literal and completely misses the idiomatic meaning of the source text. The source means ""it is raining heavily,"" while the translation means ""it is raining literal cats and dogs,"" which is factually and semantically incorrect.)
Fluency: 0 point (The phrase ""Umuulan ng pusa at aso"" is grammatically structured but is completely unnatural and non-idiomatic in Filipino. It sounds bizarre and would not be understood as ""heavy rain."" The fluent Filipino equivalent is ""Napakalakas ng ulan."")
Coherence: 0 point (The translated text is incoherent in a real-world context. While the source text is a coherent and understood idiom in English, the literal translation creates a nonsensical and illogical image in Filipino.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 0 point (The translation fails to adapt a culture-specific English idiom into a culturally appropriate Filipino equivalent. This direct translation is jarring and demonstrates a lack of cultural awareness.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation violates the primary guideline for handling idioms, which is to translate the meaning, not the literal words. A word-for-word translation is incorrect for this type of expression.)
Completeness: 0 point (The translation is incomplete as it fails to include the core information of the source text, which is the *intensity* (""heavily"") of the rain. It only translates the components of the idiom, not its meaning.)

The party of the first part shall not be held liable for any unforeseen damages.,Ang partido ng unang bahagi ay hindi mananagot para sa anumang hindi inaasahang pinsala.,4,"Accurate and understandable, good for formal/legal context.","Effectively conveys legal terminology, correct but a bit stiff.",Roi Victor Roberto / Alfonso Fermin,"Accuracy: 1 point (The translation perfectly captures the legal meaning of the source text. ""Partido ng unang bahagi"" is a standard, literal translation for ""party of the first part,"" ""hindi mananagot"" correctly translates ""shall not be held liable,"" and ""hindi inaasahang pinsala"" accurately means ""unforeseen damages."")
Fluency: 1 point (The use of the ""Ang... ay..."" construction is formal and appropriate for a legal document, making the sentence fluent and natural within its specific domain. The vocabulary is precise and standard.)
Coherence: 1 point (The sentence structure directly mirrors the logical flow of the English source, maintaining a clear cause-and-effect relationship without any awkward phrasing or restructuring.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation adopts a formal, legalistic tone that is entirely appropriate for a contractual clause. There are no cultural missteps.)
Guideline Adherence: 1 point (The translation uses terminology and a formal style that are standard for Filipino legal documents, adhering to the conventions of the domain.)
Completeness: 1 point (The translation includes all components of the source text: the specific party, the negation of liability, and the type of damages, with no omissions or alterations.)

Thank you for coming to the event.,Salamat sa pagpunta sa kaganapan.,5,"Perfect, natural, and accurate.","Excellent, natural, and idiomatic translation.",Roi Victor Roberto / Alfonso Fermin,"### Reference Translation
Salamat sa inyong pagdalo.

### Evaluation
**English source text:** Thank you for coming to the event.
**Translated text:** Salamat sa pagpunta sa kaganapan.

**Accuracy:** 1 point (The translation correctly conveys the core message of gratitude for attending an event. ""Salamat"" is ""Thank you,"" ""pagpunta"" is ""coming,"" and ""kaganapan"" is ""event."")

**Fluency:** 0 point (While grammatically correct, the phrasing is less natural than the reference. In Filipino, ""pagdalo"" (attendance) is more idiomatic and specific for an ""event"" than the more general ""pagpunta"" (coming/going). The reference ""Salamat sa inyong pagdalo"" is a more common and fluent expression in this context.)

**Coherence:** 1 point (The logical structure of the sentence is sound and directly mirrors the source text: [Gratitude] + [Reason]. The flow is clear and easy to understand.)

**Cultural Appropriateness:** 0 point (The translation lacks common Filipino politeness markers. When thanking guests at an event, it is culturally standard to use ""po"" or the formal/plural ""inyo""/""ninyo"" (e.g., ""Salamat po"" or ""Salamat sa inyong pagdalo""). The bare ""Salamat"" can be perceived as too informal or lacking the expected level of respect for the context.)

**Guideline Adherence:** 0 point (The translation deviates from the reference's idiomatic style. It uses a literal word-for-word approach (""pagpunta sa kaganapan"") instead of the more concise and contextually appropriate ""inyong pagdalo"" (your attendance), which is stylistically preferred for this type of formal expression.)

**Completeness:** 1 point (The translation includes all the necessary components of the source text: the expression of thanks, the action of coming, and the concept of the event. No information is missing.)

"Despite her exhaustion, she finished the report before the deadline.","Sa kabila ng kanyang pagod, natapos niya ang ulat bago ang deadline.",5,"Excellent, accurate, and flows well.","Fluent, accurate, and retains original meaning.",Roi Victor Roberto / Alfonso Fermin,"English - Despite her exhaustion, she finished the report before the deadline.
Translated - Sa kabila ng kanyang pagod, natapos niya ang ulat bago ang deadline.

Accuracy: 1 point (The translation perfectly captures the original meaning. ""Sa kabila ng"" is an exact equivalent for ""Despite,"" and all other elements of the sentence are accurately conveyed.)
Fluency: 1 point (The sentence structure and word choice are completely natural and fluent in Filipino. This is how a native speaker would phrase the idea.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical flow perfectly mirrors the source, with the concessive clause leading into the main clause, which is a common and coherent structure in Filipino.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is neutral and appropriate. The use of the loanword ""deadline"" is standard and culturally acceptable in both professional and informal Filipino contexts.)
Guideline Adherence: 1 point (The translation is a textbook example of a high-quality translation for this sentence. It adheres to all standard grammatical and stylistic conventions of Filipino.)
Completeness: 1 point (The translation includes all key information from the source: the state of exhaustion, the action of finishing, the report, and the time constraint of the deadline.)

That designer bag costs an arm and a leg.,Napakamahal ng designer bag na 'yan.,5,"Accurate, Fluent, Coherent, Complete, and captures the meaning of the idiomatic expression.","Complete, and sounds natural. Captures the meaning well.",Boris Victoria / Joel Ethan Batac,"Here is the evaluation based on the provided texts.

**Reference Translation:** Ginto ang presyo ng designer bag na 'yan.

### Evaluation

**Accuracy:** 1 point (The translated text accurately conveys the core meaning of the source text—that the bag is extremely expensive. ""Napakamahal"" is a direct and correct interpretation of ""costs an arm and a leg."")

**Fluency:** 1 point (The phrase ""Napakamahal ng designer bag na 'yan"" is exceptionally fluent and natural in Filipino. It is a common and standard way to express that something is very expensive.)

**Coherence:** 1 point (The structure of the translated sentence is logical and flows naturally in Filipino. The relationship between the subject (the bag) and its quality (being expensive) is clear and direct.)

**Cultural Appropriateness:** 1 point (The translation is culturally appropriate. It conveys the informal, emphatic tone of the English idiom without using any language that would be out of place.)

**Guideline Adherence:** 0 points (The source text's defining feature is its use of a figurative idiom. The translation opts for a literal description (""Napakamahal"") instead of a corresponding Filipino idiom like the reference ""Ginto ang presyo..."". This is a stylistic deviation that misses the figurative quality of the original text.)

**Completeness:** 1 point (The translation is complete. It includes all the essential information from the source: the object (""designer bag na 'yan"") and its quality of being extremely expensive.)

"I didn’t want to go to the dentist, but I had to bite the bullet and get it over with.","Ayoko sanang pumunta sa dentista, pero kailangan kong tiisin ito para matapos na.",4,"Complete, and accurately translates the idiomatic expression, with slight errors in tenses. The translation doesn't capture that the event was already done in the past. ",Good translation but conjugation is incorrect,Boris Victoria / Joel Ethan Batac,"As a strict translation judge, I will now evaluate the translation.

**Reference Translation:** Ayaw kong pumunta sa dentista, pero kinailangan kong lakasan ang loob ko para matapos na ito.

### Evaluation

**Accuracy:** 0 point (The translation uses ""tiisin"" (to endure), which captures part of the meaning. However, it misses the core nuance of the idiom ""bite the bullet,"" which is about forcing oneself to be courageous. The reference translation's ""lakasan ang loob"" (to gather courage) is a more accurate idiomatic equivalent, so the meaning in the translated text differs.)

**Fluency:** 1 point (The translated text is highly fluent and natural. The phrasing `Ayoko sanang... pero kailangan kong tiisin... para matapos na` is a common and stylistically excellent way to express this sentiment in Filipino.)

**Coherence:** 1 point (The logical flow of the sentence is perfect and directly mirrors the cause-and-effect structure of the source text. The use of ""pero"" and ""para"" creates a seamless and logical connection between the clauses.)

**Cultural Appropriateness:** 1 point (The tone is informal and personal, which is a perfect match for the source text. ""Tiisin"" is a culturally appropriate and commonly used term for enduring unpleasant but necessary situations.)

**Guideline Adherence:** 0 point (The translation deviates from the reference by choosing a different term for the central idiom. While ""tiisin"" is a valid interpretation, it is not the more precise idiomatic equivalent ""lakasan ang loob"" used in the reference, thus differing in terminology and style.)

**Completeness:** 0 point (The translated text alters a key piece of information from the reference. The reference's concept of ""lakasan ang loob"" (gathering courage) is altered to ""tiisin"" (to endure). According to the strict criteria, this alteration means the translation is not complete.)

Mark accidentally let the cat out of the bag about the surprise trip.,Hindi sinasadyang nailabas ni Mark ang pusa mula sa maleta tungkol sa surprise trip.,3,"Complete, and gramatically correct. However, the idiomatic expression was translated literally which loses the original intent of the sentence.",Idiom was not translated correctly,Boris Victoria / Joel Ethan Batac,"English - Mark accidentally let the cat out of the bag about the surprise trip.
Translated - Hindi sinasadyang nailabas ni Mark ang pusa mula sa maleta tungkol sa surprise trip.

Accuracy: 0 point (The translation completely fails to capture the meaning of the source text. It translates the idiom ""let the cat out of the bag"" literally, resulting in a sentence about physically taking a cat out of a suitcase, not about revealing a secret.)
Fluency: 0 point (The sentence is grammatically awkward and completely unnatural in Filipino for the intended meaning. A fluent translation would use a phrase like ""naibuking"" or ""naisiwalat"" to convey the revealing of a secret.)
Coherence: 0 point (The logical connection is destroyed. The translated text creates a nonsensical scenario where physically removing a cat from a suitcase is somehow related to a surprise trip, which is incoherent.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 0 point (The translation demonstrates a critical failure to understand and adapt a common English idiom for a Filipino audience. This literal translation is culturally and linguistically inappropriate as it misses the idiomatic meaning entirely.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation breaks the fundamental guideline of translating meaning over literal words. It fails to use the correct idiomatic style required by the source text, opting for a nonsensical literal interpretation.)
Completeness: 0 point (The core piece of information—that a secret was revealed—is completely missing and replaced with an incorrect action. Therefore, the translation is not complete as it fails to convey the main event of the source text.)

I won’t be able to attend the meeting later because I’m feeling under the weather.,Hindi ako makakadalo sa meeting mamaya dahil masama ang pakiramdam ko.,5,"Accurate, Fluent, Coherent, Complete, and captures the meaning of the idiomatic expression.",Complete and grammatically correct,Boris Victoria / Joel Ethan Batac,"Accuracy: 1 point (The translation perfectly captures the meaning of the source text. ""Hindi ako makakadalo"" correctly translates ""I won't be able to attend,"" and ""masama ang pakiramdam ko"" is the direct and most common idiomatic equivalent of ""feeling under the weather."")
Fluency: 1 point (The sentence structure is natural and flows exactly as a native Filipino speaker would say it. The use of ""meeting"" is common in modern Filipino, and the phrasing is smooth and idiomatic.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical connection between the inability to attend and the reason for it is clearly and correctly established using ""dahil"" (because), mirroring the coherence of the source text.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is respectful and appropriate for informing someone of an absence due to illness. ""Masama ang pakiramdam ko"" is the standard, polite way to express this in Filipino culture.)
Guideline Adherence: 1 point (The translation adheres to the unstated guideline of producing a natural, contemporary Filipino translation. It uses vocabulary and structure that are standard for everyday communication.)
Completeness: 1 point (All components of the source sentence—the speaker, the inability to attend, the event, the time, the reason, and the state of health—are fully present and correctly translated.)

Darkness is not heresy. It lies within us all.,Hindi kasalanan ang kadiliman. Nagsisinungaling ito sa loob natin.,2,"flawed translation takes ""lies"" as literal ""being untruthful"" or ""nagsisinungaling""",,Elijah Rosario/John Kirsten Espiritu,"Accuracy: 0 point (The translation is highly inaccurate. It incorrectly translates ""heresy"" to ""kasalanan"" (sin), which have different meanings. More significantly, it misinterprets the verb ""lies"" (resides/is situated) as ""lies"" (tells an untruth), resulting in ""nagsisinungaling"" (is lying). This completely distorts the original message.)
Fluency: 0 point (The second sentence, ""Nagsisinungaling ito sa loob natin,"" is grammatically formed but semantically nonsensical in this context. The bizarre meaning makes the translation unnatural and jarring to read, thus it is not fluent.)
Coherence: 0 point (The logical flow is destroyed. The original text makes a claim and then provides an explanation. The translation connects two unrelated and illogical ideas: ""Darkness is not sin"" and ""It is lying inside us,"" rendering the entire statement incoherent.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation does not use any culturally offensive or disrespectful language. While the word choice is wrong, the tone itself is neutral and does not violate cultural norms.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation fails to use the correct terminology. ""Heresy"" should be ""erehiya,"" and ""lies within"" should be ""nananahan"" or ""nasa loob."" The chosen words are a severe deviation from the accurate reference.)
Completeness: 0 point (The translation is incomplete as it omits the word ""all"" from the phrase ""us all."" The word ""natin"" translates to ""us,"" but misses the encompassing nature of ""all,"" which would be ""nating lahat."")

This would be easier if blood came in more colours.,Ito ay magiging mas madali kung ang dugo ay dumating sa mas maraming kulay.,2,"flawed translation takes ""came in more colors"" literally",,Elijah Rosario/John Kirsten Espiritu,"Here is the evaluation of the translation:

**Reference Translation:** Mas madali sana kung iba-iba ang kulay ng dugo.

---

**Accuracy:** 0 points (The translation alters the meaning. ""Ito ay magiging mas madali"" translates to ""This will be easier,"" losing the hypothetical mood of the source's ""would be,"" which is better captured by ""sana."" Additionally, ""dumating"" (arrived) is an incorrect literal translation for the phrasal verb ""came in,"" which implies existence or availability.)

**Fluency:** 0 points (The sentence is not fluent. Using ""ay"" twice makes the structure stilted and formal. More importantly, the phrase ""dumating sa mas maraming kulay"" is completely unnatural in Filipino; a native speaker would not say that blood ""arrives"" in colors.)

**Coherence:** 0 points (The use of the illogical verb ""dumating"" disrupts the coherence of the sentence, making the idea sound strange and nonsensical. The structure is less seamless than the reference translation's integrated flow.)

**Cultural Appropriateness:** 1 point (The translation does not contain any culturally inappropriate elements. The tone is neutral and aligns with the source text.)

**Guideline Adherence:** 0 points (The translation deviates significantly from the idiomatic style of the reference. It opts for a literal translation (""dumating"") instead of a natural equivalent (""iba-iba ang kulay"") and uses a clunky structure instead of the more fluid form used in the reference.)

**Completeness:** 0 points (The translation alters key information from the source. The conditional mood (""would"") is lost and changed to a future tense (""magiging""). This is a significant alteration of the original information, making the translation incomplete in its conveyance of meaning.)

**English source text:** This guy right here is Shadow, and he's kinda my biggest rival. He's also a real buzz-kill.
**Translated text:** Ang lalaking ito dito ay si Shadow, at siya ang aking pinakamalaking karibal. Isa rin siyang totoong buzz-kill.

### Evaluation

**Accuracy: 0 point**
The translation omits the word ""kinda,"" which is a crucial softener in the source text. This changes the meaning from ""he's sort of my biggest rival"" to a more definitive ""he is my biggest rival,"" thus losing the nuance and attitude of the speaker.

**Fluency: 0 point**
The translation uses a mix of formal and informal language that results in a stilted, unnatural flow. The use of the ""ay"" construction and ""aking"" is more formal than the source text's casual tone. Phrasing like ""totoong buzz-kill"" is a very literal translation of ""a real buzz-kill"" and lacks the natural idiomatic quality of a native speaker, who might say ""sobrang buzz-kill"" or use a local equivalent like ""KJ"" (Kill-Joy).

**Coherence: 1 point**
The logical structure of the translation perfectly mirrors the source text. It presents the information in the same sequence: identifying the person, stating the rivalry, and adding a second characteristic. The use of ""at"" (and) and ""rin"" (also) ensures the sentences connect logically.

**Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point**
The translation is culturally appropriate. Using the untranslated loanword ""buzz-kill"" is very common in modern, informal Filipino (Taglish) and would be understood by the likely target audience for this type of dialogue. The tone is not disrespectful or otherwise harmful.

**Guideline Adherence: 0 point**
The translation fails to adhere to the informal, casual style of the source text. The inconsistent tone, mixing formal grammar with a code-switched term, represents a stylistic deviation. A better translation would have maintained a consistent informal style throughout.

**Completeness: 0 point**
The translation is incomplete because it entirely omits the word ""kinda."" This word is a key piece of information that qualifies the statement about the rivalry, and its absence means a part of the original message is lost.

Pagnanakaw is theft. wrong translation entirely.",Elijah Rosario/John Kirsten Espiritu,"### Reference Translation
Hindi bagay sa iyo ang pagiging palihim. Pero nakakatuwa na sinusubukan mo.

### Evaluation
**Accuracy:** 0 point (The translation fundamentally misunderstands ""stealth,"" translating it as ""pagnanakaw"" (stealing). This completely changes the meaning and intent of the source text from being about sneakiness to being about a criminal act.)

**Fluency:** 0 point (The phrasing ""Ngunit ito ay kaibig-ibig"" is a very literal and unnatural translation of ""But it's adorable."" A more fluent and common equivalent would be ""Pero nakakatuwa"" or ""Pero ang cute."" The overall structure is stiff.)

**Coherence:** 0 point (The mistranslation of ""stealth"" as ""stealing"" makes the sentence incoherent. Stating that an attempt at stealing is ""adorable"" creates a logical and tonal contradiction that does not exist in the source text.)

**Cultural Appropriateness:** 0 point (The translation creates a culturally inappropriate message. Praising an attempt at ""pagnanakaw"" (stealing) as ""kaibig-ibig"" (adorable/lovely) is nonsensical and misrepresents the teasing, lighthearted tone of the original.)

**Guideline Adherence:** 0 point (The translation fails to adhere to the correct terminology (""pagnanakaw"" for ""stealth"") and style. The reference uses more natural and appropriate terms like ""pagiging palihim"" and ""nakakatuwa,"" which the translation misses entirely.)

**Completeness:** 0 point (The key information of ""stealth"" is fundamentally altered to ""stealing,"" which is a failure to preserve the original message. Therefore, the translation is not a complete representation of the source.)

### Evaluation

Accuracy: 1 point (The translated text successfully conveys the core question of the source text—asking for the country where the specific village is located.)
Fluency: 0 point (The ""Ang... ay..."" structure is grammatically correct but less fluent and natural for a question compared to the reference's ""Saang bansa..."" structure, which places the question word at the beginning for a more common interrogative flow.)

"With what would you use a ""wah-wah pedal?","Ano ang gagamitin mo ng ""wah-wah pedal?",1,Incoherent sentence due to trying to match english sentence word-per-word,Wrong verb-tense which makes the sentence sound like nonsense.,Enrique Lejano / Monica Manlises,"Here is the evaluation of the English-to-Filipino translation.

**Reference Translation:** Sa ano mo gagamitin ang ""wah-wah pedal""?

### Evaluation:
**Accuracy:** 0 point (The translation fundamentally changes the question. The source ""With what"" asks what instrument or device the pedal is used with, while the translation ""Ano ang gagamitin mo..."" asks ""What will you use..."" which is a different question. The meaning is not accurately conveyed.)

**Fluency:** 0 point (The sentence ""Ano ang gagamitin mo ng 'wah-wah pedal'?"" is grammatically incorrect and unnatural in Filipino. The use of ""ng"" is improper in this structure, making the sentence sound awkward and nonsensical.)

**Coherence:** 0 point (The logical structure is broken. The question starts as ""What will you use?"" and then improperly appends ""ng 'wah-wah pedal',"" creating a confusing and incoherent sentence. The reference flows logically from the prepositional phrase to the verb and object.)

**Cultural Appropriateness:** 1 point (The tone of the translation is neutral and inquisitive, which is appropriate for the context. It does not contain any culturally insensitive elements.)

**Guideline Adherence:** 0 point (The translation significantly deviates from the reference's structure and terminology. It incorrectly uses ""Ano"" instead of ""Sa ano"" and features incorrect grammar, failing to adhere to the standard style for this type of question.)

**Completeness:** 0 point (The translation is incomplete as it omits the crucial preposition ""With"" (Sa). This omission alters the core information of the source text, changing the entire meaning of the question.)

The meaning is not lost.)
Fluency: 0 point (The phrase ""paksa sa ngipin"" is a very literal translation of ""topics in teeth"" and is less natural than the more idiomatic ""paksa tungkol sa ngipin"" (topics about teeth) or ""usaping pang-ngipin"" (dental matters).)
Coherence: 1 point (The sentence structure is logical and follows a standard Filipino question format. The flow of ideas is clear and mirrors the source text.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone of the translation is neutral and informative, which is appropriate for the educational or medical context of the question.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation adheres to a very literal style with ""paksa sa ngipin."" A style guide for Filipino would likely recommend a more natural and common phrasing, making this a deviation from idiomatic norms.)

Sumisid sa binagong edisyon ng larong ito, na kinabibilangan ng access sa digital bonus media.

Accuracy: 0 point (The translation of ""vanquishing"" to ""pagtalo"" (defeating) loses the original's stronger connotation of complete dominance or conquest. A more accurate term would be ""paglupig"". This small but significant difference in meaning warrants a deduction.)
Fluency: 0 point (The translation is stilted. The use of loanwords like ""smash-hit"" and ""quintessential"" is acceptable but less fluid than native equivalents (""sikat na sikat"", ""pinakatunay""). More importantly, ""Sumisid"" is a very literal translation of ""Dive in"" and not an idiomatic call to action for a game, where ""Subukan na"" or ""Maglaro na"" would be more natural.)

### Evaluation:

**Accuracy: 0 points** (The translation uses ""nagpabago"" (changed), which is past tense, differing from the source's continuous effect ""change"". The reference uses the more accurate present tense ""nagpapabago"" (changes). Additionally, literal translations like ""mabibigat"" for ""heavy"" and ""sobrang mga kakayahan ng tao"" for ""superhuman abilities"" miss the more precise, contextual meaning that the reference captures with ""malalakas"" and the loanword ""superhuman"".)

**Fluency: 0 points** (The translation suffers from several unnatural phrases due to literalism. ""Labanan ang kanyang daan"" is a direct translation of the English idiom ""fight his way"" and is awkward in Filipino. The reference's ""makipaglaban patungo sa kaligtasan"" is far more fluent. The phrasing ""sobrang mga kakayahan ng tao"" is also clunky compared to the reference's use of the common loan term ""superhuman na abilidad"".)

**Coherence: 1 point** (The logical flow of the translation mirrors the source text. It correctly presents the game's description first, followed by the sequence of actions the player will undertake. The structure is logical and easy to follow, similar to the reference.)

**Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point** (The translation maintains a neutral, descriptive tone suitable for a video game summary. There are no culturally inappropriate terms or shifts in tone.)

**Guideline Adherence: 0 points** (The translation deviates from the style of a high-quality, natural reference for this domain. It avoids common and accepted gaming loanwords (""Rogue-like"", ""superhuman"") in favor of awkward literal translations (""parang Rogue"", ""sobrang mga kakayahan ng tao""). This literal approach breaks from the typical style used in Filipino gaming localization, which the reference text adheres to.)

**Completeness: 1 point** (All key pieces of information from the source text are present in the translation. It mentions the game title, genre, core mechanics, character journey, treasures, abilities, enemies, secrets, and the final goal.)

""Ultimate"" is mistranslated as ""pinakahuling"" (the very last), ""everything at your disposal"" (resources/tools) is incorrectly changed to ""lahat ng iyong makakaya"" (all of your ability/effort), and most critically, ""excitement"" is translated as ""kaguluhan,"" which means chaos or trouble, the direct opposite of the intended feeling.)
Fluency: 0 point (While grammatically structured, the text is not fluent due to unnatural and incorrect word choices. The use of ""pinakahuling"" for ""ultimate"" is awkward, and ""kaguluhan"" for ""excitement"" makes the sentence nonsensical in its context, disrupting the natural flow of a marketing message.)
Coherence: 1 point (The translation follows the logical flow and sentence structure of the source text perfectly. Each clause is presented in the same order as the original, maintaining the structural coherence of the message.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 0 point (The translation severely harms the message's tone by translating ""excitement"" to ""kaguluhan"" (chaos/trouble). For a video game advertisement, this changes the tone from thrilling and fun to negative and stressful, which is culturally inappropriate for the intended marketing purpose.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation fails to adhere to standard terminology for this domain. Key marketing terms like ""ultimate,"" ""at your disposal,"" and ""excitement"" are mistranslated with words that a professional, domain-aware reference would not use. These are not stylistic choices but terminological errors.)
Completeness: 0 point (The translation alters key pieces of information, thus failing the completeness criterion. The meaning of ""ultimate,"" the nature of the resources (""at your disposal""), and the type of emotion (""excitement"") are all changed, resulting in an incomplete and distorted transfer of the original information.)

Translated - Matagal na, matagal na tayong dalawa naghahanap sa isa't isa.

Accuracy: 1 point (The translation perfectly captures the core meaning: two people have been searching for each other for an extended time. The repetition of ""matagal na"" effectively mirrors the repetition of ""for so long"" in the source.)
Fluency: 1 point (The phrasing ""Matagal na, matagal na tayong dalawa..."" is very natural and idiomatic in Filipino, especially in a conversational or lyrical context. It flows smoothly and sounds authentic.)
Coherence: 1 point (The structure is logical and clear. Placing the repeated time adverb ""Matagal na"" at the beginning correctly emphasizes the duration, mirroring the structure and intent of the source text.)

### Evaluation

**Accuracy:** 1 point (The translation perfectly captures the meaning of the source text. ""Hindi ko mapigilang ngumiti"" is a direct and precise equivalent of ""I can't stop smiling,"" and ""tuwing andiyan ka"" accurately translates ""when you're there."")

**Fluency:** 1 point (The sentence is grammatically correct, natural, and idiomatic in Filipino. The phrasing is common in everyday conversation and flows smoothly.)

**English source text:** I just want to be your everything.
**Translated text:** Nais ko lang ay maging lahat para sa’yo

---

**Accuracy: 1 point**
The translation accurately captures the core romantic sentiment of the source text. ""Nais ko lang"" correctly translates to ""I just want,"" and ""maging lahat para sa'yo"" (to be everything for you) is an idiomatic and faithful rendition of ""to be your everything"" in a Filipino context.

**Fluency: 0 points**
The use of the ""Nais... ay..."" construction is grammatically correct but sounds formal and slightly stiff. A more natural and fluent phrasing in modern conversational Filipino would omit the ""ay,"" such as ""Gusto ko lang maging lahat para sa'yo"" or ""Nais kong maging lahat para sa'yo."" The current structure is less fluid than the common vernacular.

**Coherence: 1 point**
The logical flow of the sentence is perfectly clear. The structure (""My only wish is... to be everything for you"") is a valid and coherent way to express the thought in Filipino, even if it is a formal construction. The relationship between the desire and the outcome is well-structured.

**Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point**
The translation is highly appropriate. Using ""Nais"" instead of the more common ""Gusto"" adds a layer of sincerity and poetic depth, which fits the romantic and heartfelt tone of the source text perfectly. It conveys deep affection in a culturally resonant way.

**Guideline Adherence: 0 points**
The translation deviates from the style of a more common, idiomatic reference. The formal ""ay"" construction is stylistically different from the more prevalent and natural-sounding structures used in everyday speech, which would be the preferred style for this type of phrase.

**Completeness: 1 point**
All components of the source text are present in the translation. ""I"" (ko), ""just"" (lang), ""want"" (Nais), ""to be"" (maging), ""your"" (sa'yo), and ""everything"" (lahat) are all accounted for, fully preserving the original message.

Translated - Tuwing bakasyon, binibisita ng mga Pilipino ang kani-kanilang mga pamilya

Accuracy: 0 point (The translation is inaccurate. It substitutes ""relatives"" with ""pamilya"" (families) and ""holidays"" with ""bakasyon"" (vacation). ""Relatives"" (mga kamag-anak) is a broader term than ""family,"" and ""holidays"" (mga pista opisyal) is not synonymous with ""vacation."")
Fluency: 1 point (The translated sentence is grammatically correct and uses a natural, common Filipino sentence structure (Adverb of Time + Verb + Actor + Object). It flows well and is easy to understand.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical flow of the sentence is perfectly coherent. The placement of ""Tuwing bakasyon"" at the beginning clearly sets the time context for the action that follows.)

Translated - Ang Adobo ay isa sa mga pinakasikat na ulam sa Pilipinas at ito ay gawa sa toyo, suka, at bawang.

Accuracy: 1 point (The translation accurately conveys all the key information: Adobo is a popular dish in the Philippines, and it is made from soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic. No meaning is lost or altered.)
Fluency: 0 points (The use of ""at ito ay"" is grammatically correct but creates a slightly clunky and less natural flow. A more fluent construction would be ""...sa Pilipinas, na gawa sa..."" which uses a relative clause to smoothly connect the second part of the description, mirroring the original sentence's structure more elegantly.)
Coherence: 0 points (The source text presents the information as a single, coherent thought, with ""made with..."" acting as a direct descriptor. The translation breaks this into two separate clauses joined by ""at"" (""and""), which slightly disrupts the seamless logical flow of the original.)

**Reference Translation (for evaluation purposes):** Kilala sa buong mundo ang pagkamapagpatuloy ng mga Pilipino.

---

### Evaluation

**Accuracy:** 1 point (The translated text accurately conveys the meaning of the source text—that the hospitality of Filipinos is known globally. ""Pagiging hospitable"" is a direct and correct equivalent for ""hospitability"".)

**Fluency:** 0 point (The ""Ang... ay..."" construction, while grammatically correct, is more formal and slightly less fluid than the predicate-first structure of the reference translation (""Kilala... ang...""), which is a more common and natural-sounding sentence pattern in Filipino.)

**Coherence:** 0 point (The sentence structure differs from the reference. The reference's predicate-first structure (""Kilala sa buong mundo..."") immediately presents the main idea, creating a more direct and seamless flow. The translated text's structure slightly separates the subject and predicate, making it less integrated.)

**Cultural Appropriateness:** 1 point (The tone is neutral and respectful. The use of the loanword ""hospitable"" is very common and culturally acceptable in modern Filipino.)

**Guideline Adherence:** 0 point (The translation deviates from the reference's style and terminology. It uses a formal ""Ang... ay..."" structure and a loanword (""hospitable"") instead of the reference's more idiomatic predicate-first structure and native term (""pagkamapagpatuloy"").)

**Completeness:** 1 point (The translation includes all key information from the source text: the concept of hospitality, the Filipinos, the fact that it is known, and the worldwide scope.)

We love to celebrate fiestas and gatherings with family and friends,Mahal natin ang pagdidiwang ng piyesta and salo-salo kasama ang pamilya at mga kaibigan,3,"doesnt sound natural, could be better with Mahilig tayo magdiwang ng piyesta at salo-salo kasama ng ating pamilya at mga kaibigan",salo-salo could be replaced with pagtitipon for accurate translation,Charlyne Arajoy Carabeo/Geena Tibule,"Here is the evaluation based on the provided texts and a high-quality reference translation.

**Reference Translation:** Mahilig tayong magdiwang ng mga piyesta at salu-salo kasama ang pamilya at mga kaibigan.

---

### Evaluation

**Accuracy:** 0 point
The translation ""Mahal natin ang pagdidiwang"" means ""We love the celebration"" (noun), which is a subtle but distinct shift in meaning from the source ""We love to celebrate"" (verb/action). The reference ""Mahilig tayong magdiwang"" more accurately captures the fondness for the act of celebrating.

**Fluency:** 0 point
The use of the English word ""and"" instead of the Filipino ""at"" is an instance of code-switching that makes the sentence less fluent and stylistically inconsistent compared to the reference. Additionally, ""Mahilig tayong magdiwang"" is a more natural and common phrasing in Filipino than the more literal ""Mahal natin ang pagdidiwang.""

**Coherence:** 1 point
The logical flow of the sentence is sound and follows the structure of the source text (Subject -> Action -> Details). The ideas are connected in a way that is easy to understand and does not differ from the coherent structure of the reference.

**Cultural Appropriateness:** 1 point
The translation uses culturally specific and appropriate terms like ""piyesta"" and ""salo-salo,"" which perfectly capture the essence of Filipino celebrations. The tone is warm and communal, which is appropriate for the message.

**Guideline Adherence:** 0 point
The translation deviates from the style of the reference by code-switching (""and"") and by using a more literal phrasal construction (""Mahal natin ang pagdidiwang"") instead of the more idiomatic style of the reference (""Mahilig tayong magdiwang"").

**Completeness:** 1 point
The translation successfully includes all key pieces of information from the source text: the subject (""We""), the action (""love to celebrate""), the events (""fiestas and gatherings""), and the company (""with family and friends"").

Translated - Ang adobo at sinigang ay ilan lamang sa masasarap na pagkaing Pilipino na talaga naman hinahanap-hanap

Accuracy: 1 point (The translation accurately conveys the full meaning of the source. ""Talaga naman hinahanap-hanap"" is an excellent and precise idiomatic translation for ""truly craved,"" capturing the nuance of longing.)
Fluency: 1 point (The sentence is highly fluent and sounds natural to a native Filipino speaker. The use of ""talaga naman"" and ""hinahanap-hanap"" are common and idiomatic.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical structure is flawless. The sentence flows clearly from the subject (adobo and sinigang) to the description, maintaining the same coherent thought process as the source text.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is perfect for discussing beloved national foods. The phrase ""hinahanap-hanap"" correctly captures the cultural sentiment of missing or longing for a familiar taste from home.)

Translated - Bahagi ng ating kultura ang pagkain ng kanin sa halos bawat pagkain
Accuracy: 1 point (The translation perfectly captures the meaning of the source text. ""Bahagi ng ating kultura"" correctly translates ""part of our culture,"" and ""pagkain ng kanin sa halos bawat pagkain"" accurately means ""eating rice with almost every meal."")
Fluency: 1 point (The sentence structure is natural and idiomatic in Filipino. The inverted form ""[Predicate] ang [Subject]"" is very common and flows smoothly.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical flow is excellent. The relationship between the concepts—the act of eating rice and its place in the culture—is clearly and correctly established using a standard Filipino sentence pattern.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is neutral and factual, which is entirely appropriate for the statement. The choice of words like ""ating kultura"" and ""kanin"" is perfectly suited to the context.)
Guideline Adherence: 1 point (The translation uses standard, widely accepted terminology. It is a textbook example of how to translate this phrase, adhering to common grammatical and stylistic norms.)

There could've been a better term.,Darryl Ty/Rafael Yap,"Accuracy: 1 point (The translation accurately conveys the essential information from the source: the nurse's incorrect action with the IV led to a bruise. The core cause-and-effect relationship is maintained.)
Fluency: 0 point (The verb ""pinasok"" (entered) is understandable but not the natural or standard term for inserting an IV; ""ikinabit"" or ""itinusok"" would be more fluent. The ""Ang...ay..."" structure is also slightly more formal and less common than a verb-first construction.)
Coherence: 1 point (The translated sentence follows a clear and logical cause-and-effect structure (""...kaya..."") that directly mirrors the source text, making the relationship between the two clauses perfectly coherent.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone of the translation is neutral and factual, which is appropriate for describing a medical incident. It avoids any disrespectful or overly emotional language.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (In the medical domain, the term ""pinasok"" is incorrect terminology for inserting an IV. The standard term is ""ikinabit"" (to attach/install) or ""itinusok"" (to prick/inject), so the translation fails to adhere to domain-specific language.)
Completeness: 1 point (The translation includes all key elements from the source text: the nurse, the IV, the incorrect insertion, the causation, and the resulting bruise. No information is missing.)

Translated - Ang pasyente ay binigyan ng penicillin upang maiwasan ang impeksyon.

Accuracy: 1 point (The translated text is a direct and accurate equivalent of the source text. All key terms—patient, given, penicillin, prevent, infection—are correctly translated.)
Fluency: 0 point (The ""Ang... ay..."" construction is grammatically correct but is a formal structure less commonly used in modern, fluent Filipino compared to the more natural verb-first sentence structure, e.g., ""Binigyan ng penicillin ang pasyente..."")
Coherence: 0 point (While the sentence is logical, its S-V-O structure differs from the standard V-S-O flow of Filipino, which connects the action to the subject more seamlessly. The use of ""ay"" creates a slight disruption in flow compared to the more common structure.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation uses a formal and neutral tone suitable for a medical context. The terminology is standard and respectful.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation uses a formal, inverted sentence structure (""di-karaniwang ayos""). Assuming a guideline that prefers the most natural and common Filipino phrasing, this stylistic choice deviates from the preferred verb-first structure.)
Completeness: 1 point (The translation completely captures all the information from the source sentence: the recipient (the patient), the action (was given), the object (penicillin), the purpose (to prevent), and the condition (infection).)

"To be able to start fasting, you have to stop eating and drinking anything except water at least 8 hours before your test.","Para makapagsimula ng fasting, tigilan ang pagkain at pag-inom 8 oras bago ang test, tubig lang pwede.",3,"""tigilan"" is awkward in the context making the phrasing weird and casual, and ""pwede"" makes the instruction sound optional when it should be strict. ","The whole sentence sounds awkward, and the number 8 could've been translated into its word form.",Darryl Ty/Rafael Yap,"### Reference Translation
Para makapagsimula ng pag-aayuno, kailangang itigil ang pagkain at pag-inom ng kahit ano maliban sa tubig nang hindi bababa sa 8 oras bago ang iyong test.

### Evaluation
**Accuracy: 0 point** (The translation alters the meaning by omitting ""at least."" Stating ""8 oras bago ang test"" (8 hours before the test) is a specific point in time, whereas the source specifies a minimum duration of ""at least 8 hours,"" which is a critical detail in a medical instruction.)

**Fluency: 0 point** (The final clause "", tubig lang pwede"" is tacked on and sounds unnatural. The structure is fragmented. The reference's integrated phrase ""...maliban sa tubig"" (except for water) flows much more smoothly within the sentence.)

**Coherence: 0 point** (The logical flow is disjointed. The exception for water is presented as an afterthought separated by a comma, rather than being an integral part of the main instruction as it is in the source and reference texts.)

**Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point** (The direct, instructional tone is culturally suitable for giving directions or medical advice. The use of loanwords like ""fasting"" and ""test"" is common and acceptable in the Philippines.)

**Guideline Adherence: 0 point** (The translation deviates significantly from the reference's style. It uses an informal, clipped structure (""tubig lang pwede"") and an imperative command (""tigilan"") instead of the more formal and precise ""kailangang itigil"" (it is necessary to stop) which better captures ""you have to"" from the source.)

**Completeness: 0 point** (The translation is incomplete as it completely omits the crucial information ""at least"" (""hindi bababa sa""). This omission is a significant alteration of the source instruction.)

",Darryl Ty/Rafael Yap,"Accuracy: 1 point (The translation accurately conveys all key elements from the source text: the need for hospital admission after a check-up for the purpose of observation and treatment.)
Fluency: 0 point (The phrase ""kailangang ma-admit ka"" is grammatically acceptable but less fluent than the more natural Filipino construction ""kailangan kang ma-admit,"" where the pronoun 'ka' is attached to the preceding word.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical structure of the sentence is correct and follows the source text's flow: condition (after the check-up), followed by the required action (admission), and the reason (observation and treatment).)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is direct and informative, which is appropriate for a medical context. The use of common loanwords like ""check-up,"" ""ma-admit,"" and ""ma-obserbahan"" is natural in modern Filipino conversation, especially in this domain.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation deviates from the most common and idiomatic phrasing. A higher-quality reference would use ""kailangan kang ma-admit"" for better style and flow, making the translated text's word order a stylistic deviation.)

""Sinisigurado"" (making sure) is a very effective and natural equivalent for ""make it a priority"" in this context.)
Fluency: 0 point (The translation uses ""Lagi ko sinisigurado,"" which is common in speech but less grammatically fluid than the standard ""Lagi kong sinisigurado."" The use of the linker ""-ng"" would make the sentence flow more naturally and is what a polished reference text would contain.)
Coherence: 1 point (The sentence structure is logical, clear, and follows a standard Filipino construction. The relationship between the ideas (prioritizing and setting aside time) is perfectly coherent.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation is culturally neutral and appropriate. The tone is personal and fits the context of talking about one's own habits.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation deviates from the standard grammatical style of a formal or high-quality reference by omitting the ""-ng"" linker in ""Lagi kong."" A strict adherence to grammatical guidelines would favor the more connected phrase.)

The correct Filipino structure requires the plural marker ""mga"" (""Isa sa mga layunin"") to accurately convey that there are multiple purposes of life, not just one.)
Fluency: 0 point (The phrase ""Isa sa layunin"" is grammatically incorrect and unnatural in Filipino. The standard, fluent construction is ""Isa sa mga layunin."" This grammatical error significantly harms the natural flow of the sentence for a native speaker.)
Coherence: 1 point (The sentence's logical structure is sound and directly mirrors the source text. The relationship between the subject (a purpose of life) and the predicate (to help others) is clear and coherent.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation uses ""tumulong sa kapwa"" (to help one's fellow person) and ""walang kapalit,"" which are culturally resonant and appropriate concepts in the Philippines, aligning perfectly with the source's benevolent tone.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation violates a fundamental rule of Filipino grammar by not using the plural form (""mga layunin"") after the phrase ""Isa sa"" (One of). A standard style guide would mandate the correct grammatical form.)
Completeness: 0 point (The translation is incomplete because it omits the plural aspect of ""purposes."" By failing to include ""mga,"" it misses the key information that helping others is one among *several* purposes of life.)

Translated - Meron akong koleksyon ng mga non-fiction na libro na palagi ko sinisigurado na organisado at malinis.

Accuracy: 0 point (The translation changes the meaning. The source describes the state of the collection (""is always well-organized""), while the translation describes an action taken by the speaker (""I always make sure it is organized""). This is a subtle but significant shift in meaning.)
Fluency: 0 point (The phrase ""palagi ko sinisigurado na organisado"" is grammatically correct but is more wordy and less fluent than a direct description like ""na laging maayos"" or ""na laging organisado,"" which would be more natural for describing a static quality.)

Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is informal and conversational, which is perfectly appropriate for the context of someone describing their personal belongings. No cultural missteps are present.)

Accuracy: 1 point (The translation correctly conveys the core meaning of the source text: that dedicating serious attention to nonsensical matters is a misuse of one's time.)
Fluency: 0 point (The sentence structure is a direct, literal translation that sounds unnatural and clunky in Filipino. The repetition of ""seryoso"" (""pagseseryoso,"" ""seryosong"") is awkward, and using ""baliw"" for ""things"" is not idiomatic. A more fluent phrasing would be ""Sayang lang sa oras ang pagpatol sa mga kalokohan."")
Coherence: 1 point (The logical structure of the sentence is sound. It follows the ""Subject + ay + Predicate"" format, which, while sometimes formal, clearly connects the idea of the action to its consequence.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is neutral and aphoristic, which is appropriate. While ""baliw"" can be a sensitive word, its application to inanimate ""bagay"" (things) fits the intended meaning of ""nonsensical"" or ""foolish"" without being offensive.)

Using ""salamin"" (mirror/reflection) for ""projection"" is an excellent idiomatic choice that accurately conveys the concept of externalizing one's internal state.)

Translated - May ilang lalaking ipinanganak na katamtaman, may ilang nakakamit ang pagiging karaniwan, at may ilan na ipinipilit na lamang sa kanila ang pagiging ganoon.

Accuracy: 0 point (The translation loses precision by using three different terms—""katamtaman,"" ""karaniwan,"" and the vague pronoun ""ganoon""—for the single, powerful concept of ""mediocrity."" This variation alters the direct and impactful meaning of the original, which relies on repetition for its force.)
Fluency: 0 point (While grammatically correct, the translation lacks the stylistic fluency of the source. The original's power comes from its rhythmic, parallel structure. The translation's use of varied vocabulary breaks this parallelism, making the sentence less elegant and memorable than a more faithful rendition.)
Coherence: 0 point (The coherence of the source text is reinforced by its strong parallel structure. The translation weakens this by breaking the repetition, especially in the final clause with ""pagiging ganoon,"" which is a less direct and less cohesive way to refer to the core idea.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation uses a standard, neutral tone that is appropriate for the philosophical and witty nature of the quote. The vocabulary is suitable and holds no inappropriate cultural connotations.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation fails to adhere to the stylistic rule of preserving rhetorical devices from the source. A reference translation would maintain the parallelism by using a single, consistent term for ""mediocrity,"" a key feature that this translation disregards.)
Completeness: 1 point (All the essential informational components from the source text are present: the three distinct ways men encounter mediocrity—by birth, by achievement, and by imposition—are all included in the translated text.)

Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure.,Sumakabilang-buhay si Inay ngayong araw. O baka kahapon; medyo nalilito na ako.,2,The tone in the translated text feels too colloquial.,Doesn't feel natural. Too literal.,Lia Guillermo/Lester Anthony Sityar,"English source text: Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure.
Translated text: Sumakabilang-buhay si Inay ngayong araw. O baka kahapon; medyo nalilito na ako.

### Evaluation

A reference translation aiming for tonal fidelity to the famous literary source would be: ""Namatay si Inay ngayon. O baka kahapon; hindi ako sigurado."" This reference prioritizes the blunt, detached tone of the original text.

**Accuracy: 0 points**
The translation alters the core tone and meaning. ""Sumakabilang-buhay"" is a respectful euphemism for ""passed away,"" which contrasts sharply with the blunt and emotionally detached ""died"" in the source. Furthermore, ""medyo nalilito na ako"" (I'm a bit confused now) changes the narrator's statement of factual uncertainty (""I can't be sure"") into a description of their emotional or mental state, which is a significant change in meaning.

**Fluency: 1 point**
The translated sentence is grammatically correct and flows naturally in conversational Filipino. The phrasing is common and idiomatic for the subject matter in a typical Filipino context.

**Coherence: 1 point**
The logical structure of the translation perfectly mirrors the source text. It presents a primary statement, followed by an alternative, and concludes with a statement of uncertainty. The flow is coherent and follows the original sequence.

**Cultural Appropriateness: 0 points**
The source text's power comes from its *lack* of cultural appropriateness; the narrator's detachment is shocking. The translation imposes a culturally appropriate, respectful tone by using ""Sumakabilang-buhay."" This ""correction"" fundamentally harms the original message and misrepresents the narrator's character, who is defined by his alienation.

**Guideline Adherence: 0 points**
The domain is literary translation, where preserving the author's unique style is a key guideline. The translation deviates significantly from the source's stark and direct style, opting for a softer, more common register. This stylistic choice breaks the unwritten rule of fidelity to the tone of such a well-known piece of literature.

**Completeness: 1 point**
The translation includes all the informational components of the source sentence: the mother, the event of death, the timeframe (today or yesterday), and the narrator's uncertainty. No part of the source sentence was omitted.

"The wave returns to the ocean, where it came from, and where it's supposed to be.","Bumabalik ang alon sa karagatan, kung saan ito nanggaling, at kung saan ito dapat nasa.",2,The wording feels awkward and unnatural.,"Extremely unnatural wording, especially on ""kung saan ito dapat nasa."" Despite that, it still conveys the rough meaning of the original text.",Lanz Lim / Tyler Tan,"Accuracy: 0 point (The translation of ""where it's supposed to be"" into ""kung saan ito dapat nasa"" is a literal, word-for-word translation that fails to capture the intended meaning of belonging or being in its rightful place. A more accurate translation would be ""kung saan ito nararapat."" The chosen phrase is grammatically awkward and slightly alters the meaning.)
Fluency: 0 point (The phrase ""kung saan ito dapat nasa"" is highly unnatural and not fluent in Filipino. A native speaker would find this construction clunky and jarring. The correct and more natural expression would be ""kung saan ito nararapat,"" which flows smoothly.)
Coherence: 0 point (While the sentence follows the logical structure of the source, the final clause ""kung saan ito dapat nasa"" is grammatically incomplete and disrupts the coherent flow of the sentence. It creates a linguistic stumble that a more polished translation would avoid.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation's tone is neutral and descriptive, which is perfectly appropriate for the subject matter. It does not involve any cultural elements that could be misinterpreted.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation deviates from the style of a high-quality reference by using the literal and awkward ""dapat nasa"" instead of the more idiomatic and standard ""nararapat."" This shows a lack of adherence to producing natural-sounding Filipino.)
Completeness: 1 point (The translation includes all components of the source text: the wave, the act of returning, the ocean, the place of origin, and the rightful place. No information has been omitted.)

Sick of tea?! That's like being sick of breathing!,Ayaw mo na ng tsaa?! Parang sinabi mo na ring sawa ka nang huminga!,5,Wording is natural and uses appropriate that properly conveys the emotion in the sentence.,Exceptionally natural translation. Even conveying the emotional surprise and colloquial tone of the original text.,Lanz Lim / Tyler Tan,"English - Sick of tea?! That's like being sick of breathing!
Translated - Ayaw mo na ng tsaa?! Parang sinabi mo na ring sawa ka nang huminga!

Accuracy: 0 points (The translation uses ""Ayaw mo na ng tsaa?!"" which means ""You don't want tea anymore?!"". This captures the general idea but misses the specific nuance of ""sick of,"" which implies being tired of something from overexposure. A more accurate term would be ""Sawa ka na sa tsaa?!"". This slight difference in meaning reduces accuracy.)
Fluency: 1 point (The translated text is highly fluent and natural. The phrasing ""Parang sinabi mo na ring..."" is a common and idiomatic way to express comparison in Filipino, making the sentence flow very well.)
Coherence: 1 point (The translation perfectly maintains the logical structure of the source text. It presents a statement of disbelief followed directly by an exaggerated, parallel comparison, ensuring the message is coherent.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation effectively captures the informal, shocked, and hyperbolic tone of the source text. It is a culturally appropriate and natural expression of friendly disbelief in Filipino.)
Guideline Adherence: 0 points (The translation deviates in terminology. While it uses the correct term ""sawa ka na"" for ""sick of"" in the second clause, it uses the less precise ""Ayaw mo na"" in the first clause, differing from the reference's more direct term ""Sawa ka na"".)
Completeness: 1 point (The translation is complete and includes all the core ideas from the source: the disbelief about tea, the comparison, and the absurdity of being tired of breathing. No information is omitted.)

"I wanted to invite my youngest to go get some ice cream, if he’ll let me.","Gusto ko imbitahin yung pinakabata kong anak para kumuha ng ice cream, kung papayagan niya ako.",3,"Not the best translation while its mostly correct its not natural, for more casual contexts yayain is more commonly used, additionally youngest child has a word in tagalog called ""bunso"" that would be more appropriate here.","Although the meaning of the original sentence is there, the delivery is very stinted, especially on its word usage (pinakabata and imbitahin).",Lanz Lim / Tyler Tan,"Accuracy: 0 point (The translation misses key nuances. ""Gusto ko"" translates to ""I want,"" failing to capture the softer, past-tense ""I wanted"" from the source, which would be better conveyed by ""Gusto ko sana."" Additionally, ""para kumuha"" (to get/take) does not accurately represent the intended social activity of ""to go get some ice cream,"" which implies eating it together; ""para kumain"" (to eat) would be more accurate.)

Fluency: 0 point (The translation is not fluent or natural. A native speaker would almost always use ""bunso"" for ""youngest (child)"" instead of the literal and clunky ""pinakabata kong anak."" The phrase ""para kumuha ng ice cream"" is highly unnatural; the common idiomatic expressions are ""kumain ng ice cream"" or ""mag-ice cream."")

Coherence: 1 point (The sentence follows a logical structure that mirrors the source text: [Desire] + [Action] + [Recipient] + [Purpose] + [Condition]. The flow of ideas is clear and correctly connected.)

Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The tone is suitable for a conversation between a parent and their child. The phrase ""kung papayagan niya ako"" correctly reflects a respectful and appropriate dynamic. There are no cultural missteps.)

Guideline Adherence: 0 point (The translation deviates from the style and terminology of a standard, high-quality reference. It uses literal translations like ""pinakabata"" and ""kumuha"" instead of the more common and idiomatic terms ""bunso"" and ""kumain,"" which would be present in a reference text.)

Completeness: 1 point (All components of the source sentence are present in the translation: the desire to invite, the recipient (my youngest), the activity (get ice cream), and the condition (if he'll let me). No information is missing.)

"That person has no more respect or love for you, leave them.","Wala nang respeto at pagmamahal yung tao para sa'yo, iwan mo na.",5,The sentence flows very well and uses more informal words used in conversation like sa'yo.,"Sounds very natural, capturing the sentiment carried by the original sentence.",Lanz Lim / Tyler Tan,"Accuracy: 1 point (The translation perfectly captures the core meaning of the source text. ""Wala nang respeto at pagmamahal"" accurately conveys ""no more respect or love,"" and ""iwan mo na"" is a precise and idiomatic translation of the command ""leave them."")
Fluency: 1 point (The translation is highly fluent and natural in conversational Filipino. The sentence structure ""Wala nang... yung tao para sa'yo"" is a common and smooth way to express this idea, much more so than a literal, non-inverted structure.)
Coherence: 1 point (The logical flow of the original sentence—presenting a reason followed by a direct piece of advice—is perfectly mirrored in the translation. The two clauses are connected logically and clearly.)
Cultural Appropriateness: 1 point (The translation's tone is direct and candid, which is culturally appropriate for giving personal advice between peers in the Philippines. ""Iwan mo na"" is the standard and culturally understood phrase for this situation.)
Guideline Adherence: 1 point (The translation uses a style and terminology (""yung tao,"" ""iwan mo na"") that are perfectly suited for the informal, conversational domain of the source text. It adheres to the unstated but clear guideline of sounding natural.)
Completeness: 1 point (The translation includes all key elements from the source text: the person, the lack of respect and love, the recipient (""for you""), and the command to leave. No information is lost or omitted.)
